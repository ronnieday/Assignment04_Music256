Bumper Beats is a simple sound playground wherein elasic balls bounce between sonorous paddles.  Each paddle can be assigned it's own sampled sound, and can be moved to different distances from the center.  A grid provides refrence to common meter divisions down to 16th notes, and spanning one measure.  Because the ball speed is variable, this same window can easily be divided into multiple measures along the same grid, or it can be divided continuously into an asynchronos meditative tone texture.  Pause/play functionality, in addition to a reset button, allow the user to re-sync their beats when phase issues develop as a result of moving paddles dynamically.

For future iterations, I'd like to add support for grid locking.  I'd also like to allow the user to change between voices, adjust the pitch of each sample, and to add or subtract an arbitrary number of ball/paddle tracks.
